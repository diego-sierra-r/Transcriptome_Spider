#### DE_transcripts_counts(624).xlsx

Contains the differentially expressed transcript counts (including those that failed to be annotated and therefore are not known to be related to venom production), the "Comparation" column indicates that in which comparison determined transcript was found differentially expressed, such comparisons were taken from the column "Grupo_intra" in the database "Samples_information.csv" or Coldata ;since a transcript may be differentially expressed in multiple comparisons there are only 55 unique transcripts in the "Contig_Name" column.

At same time, this database contains the basemean values for each transcript/compararison ("baseMean" column)

- Differentially expressed transcript count between diets: 624
- Differentially expressed single transcripts between diets: 195
- Dnique transcripts differentially expressed and noted between diets: 55 (turn out to be the same as those achieved when comparing the differential expression between diets)

#### raw_counts_DE_annoted_and_venom_related_diets.xlsx

Contains raw counts of differentially expressed transcripts annotated and related to venom production (55)

#### raw_counts_DE_annoted_diets.xlsx 

Contains raw counts of differentially expressed and annotated transcripts, regardless of whether or not they are related to venom production (101)
